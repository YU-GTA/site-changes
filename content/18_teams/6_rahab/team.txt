Stats: We visit massage parlours to offer our services and friendship. We help sexually exploited individuals and trafficking victims to find safety. We build trust and relationships by making friends with the women and their families, provide assistance when they need, witness Christ in their lives, bring them to church, love them as Christ loves us and receive them as part of our community.
