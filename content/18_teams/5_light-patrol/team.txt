Headingtwo: The Reality of Youth Homelessness

----

Stats: While Toronto is one of the wealthiest cities in Canada, it also has the largest population of those experiencing homelessness, and 28% of those experiencing homelessness are youth. It is our joy to get to know the people and stories behind this number, and to support them as they work towards realizing their goals and dreams.
