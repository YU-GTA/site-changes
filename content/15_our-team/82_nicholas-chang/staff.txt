Description: God brought Nicholas to YU in 2014 where Nicholas’ compassion for those in poverty and his experience in Social Work currently supports at-risk and vulnerable youth in a wholistic manner as they grow in their life journey. He hopes to share about God’s love and peace so that the youth of the community will know this truth deeply in their hearts.
