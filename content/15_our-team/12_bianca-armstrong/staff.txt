Description: I work to build relationships with homeless and street-involved youth, providing them with whole-person care. I am dedicated to walking alongside Light Patrolâ€™s youth through the light and dark seasons of their lives. I desire to join God in redeeming fundamental pieces of life that have been broken for so many youth on the street, like home and healthy relationships.
