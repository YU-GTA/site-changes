Description: Having experienced the joys and struggles of being a mother, Stephanie is excited to journey with pregnant and parenting youth, and is passionate about creating a village for what can be a very isolating time in a youth's life. Her hope is to connect young moms with community that will enrich all aspects of their lives and build confidence in who they are in Christ.
