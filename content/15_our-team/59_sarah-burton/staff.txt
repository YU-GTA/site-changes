Description: God used my mission experiences to deeply impact my life; they were a catalyst for me to join the DOXA team! My role with YU is training and mentoring students and volunteers, and planning future DOXA Journeys trips. I have a heart for the youth of our city and I love to see students encounter God in a new way as they learn to be “globally conscious and locally active”.
