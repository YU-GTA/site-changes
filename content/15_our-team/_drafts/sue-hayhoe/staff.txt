Description: Sue has worked as a volunteer with our Brampton Young Moms group for over 12 years. She is a passionate mother to four, and now grandma to seven!  When her own children were grown, she had an ache in her heart to continue to be a “mother” to others.  After having a friend introduce her to the Brampton Young Moms group, it just seemed like a natural fit. After some time, Sue moved to volunteer leader. She loves to share her faith in Jesus  and be a mentor to the young moms and other volunteers in the Brampton group.
