Description: Prison Fellowship Canada's (PFC) Bridgecare program mobilizes volunteer teams to walk alongside former prisoners with the goal of seeing them connected long-term to a local church for spiritual mentorship. The focus of this partnership will be on combining both PFCâ€™s Bridgecare program and YU programs for post-incarcerated 18-25 year-old youth in the Toronto area.
