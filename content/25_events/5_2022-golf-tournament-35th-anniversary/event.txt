Thank you to the golfers and sponsors who teed it up for youth transformation on Monday, May 9, 2022 at Blue Springs Golf Club in Acton, Ontario.

For **35 years** Youth Unlimitedâ€™s annual charity golf tournament has raised significant funds and built long-lasting partnerships that daily impact young lives throughout the GTA. This year's funds were raised in support of YU's Job Opportunity and Placement Initiative.

**It was worth the drive to help kids thrive!**
