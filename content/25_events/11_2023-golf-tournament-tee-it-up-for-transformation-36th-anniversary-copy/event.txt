On Monday, May 15th, 128 golfers enjoyed a beautiful, sunny day at Emerald Hills Golf Club in Stouffville. 

We are **so grateful** to all of our golfers, foursome hosts, sponsors, and financial contributors who made this day such a great success. This tournament is an integral part of ensuring the ongoing work of Youth Unlimited across our city.

Our fifth annual Pitch & Pledge focused on raising $47,000 to help kick-start a large-scale fundraising campaign that will support the hiring of our 36 essential summer students across the GTA. 

We were blown away by the generosity of everyone who attended our evening program and took part in our Pitch & Pledge. We raised an incredible $58,935, enough to offer 8 young people transformational employment opportunities this summer. 

Save the Date! 
Join us on Wednesday, May 15, 2024 for our 37th Annual Charity Golf Tournament at Wyndance Golf Club in Uxbridge, ON. We hope to see you there! 

Tee it up for transformation!
