As you know, charities across Canada depend significantly upon Canada Post for delivery of regular giving through the mail. Your prayers for a speedy and just resolution to the current postal strike would be greatly appreciated! 

In light of the postal strike, there are still many easy and convenient ways to give to Youth Unlimited (and these are always available to you, strike or not!):

(1) Donate **online** on (link: https://www.yugta.ca/donate text: our donate page). 
(2) **Phone** Elim at our Jonesville office at 416.383.1477 and give via your credit card.
(3) Send an **e-transfer** to donations@yugta.ca, including any gift designation and address in the message box.
(4) Donate via **stocks/securities** by emailing Scott at smoore@yugta.ca and he will email you instructions for this.
(5) Use a **courier** company that is convenient for you.
(6) Drop by our office **in person** at 95 Jonesville Crescent. We love visitors!

Thank you for being part of transformed youth transforming our city.
