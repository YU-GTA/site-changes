  heading: Telling our Stories
  text: |
    We all want to tell our stories. And we all want our stories to end well. For our legacies to count and be remembered. Often we don’t know how to go about formulating our legacy plan or who to trust to help us to do it. At YU, we understand that this task is daunting. **We can help**.
    
    We want to share what a legacy gift is and what its benefits are. As well, we invite you to take advantage of our free, friendly, high-quality estate-planning service with **Advisors with Purpose**.
