    Each of our programs relies on a
    hardworking group of volunteers who
    invest their time and energy in youth
    transformation through mentoring,
    visiting, participating in our programs,
    sharing a meal, checking in, and more.

    Mentoring, coaching, and walking
    alongside young people as they explore
    faith in Jesus and mature in life is at
    the heart of YU’s desire to live out
    wholistic transformation. As you listen
    to, care for, and helpfully support
    youth in our programs, not only will our
    young people flourish, but you will
    learn and grow too! As a volunteer, you
    can be a youth worker in one of our
    community outreach programs across the
    city, in a formal coaching relationship
    with a young Christian leader, as part
    of a service project, or many other
    potential places.

    Our young parents programs across the
    city provide a unique opportunity to
    support young dads and moms in being a
    transformative presence in their homes
    and communities. In these programs, you
    can support through group interactions,
    one-on-one mentoring, and childcare
    during programming times.

    Whether it’s on the court, doing a
    weights session after school, or working
    on artwork, your consistent presence in
    our activity or sports programs helps
    create safe spaces for our young people,
    and it is an amazing gateway to building
    long-term relationships of trust and
    care.

    Youth Unlimited has always been
    committed to going where young people
    are. Some of our programming includes
    intentional street outreach to young
    people experiencing homelessness or
    young women facing exploitative
    circumstances. Your participation as
    part of a street or parlour outreach
    team brings comfort, hope, and tangible
    help to these young friends whom we
    love.

    It’s not all about frontline work! In
    order to reach young people across the
    city, we need a great team of people
    serving behind the scenes in a variety
    of supporting roles. This could include
    joining our prayer team, providing
    clerical assistance with mailings and
    other front office work, shooting photos
    of our various programs, and helping run
    fundraising or other events throughout
    the year. Everyone has a place where
    they can meaningfully impact the youth
    of Toronto!

  heading: What To Expect
  leftheading: What’s the time commitment?
  lefttext: >
    Because relationships of trust take time
    to build, we look for a minimum one-year
    commitment for involvement with youth.
    Projects or events can be more
    short-term.
  midheading: Who can volunteer?
  midtext: >
    Due to the nature of our work with young
    people, we generally prefer youth work
    volunteers to be 21 or older. For those
    mentoring youth, volunteers share our
    faith-based approach to ministry.
  rightheading: How else can I get involved?
  righttext: >
    We welcome student placements, interns,
    and more! Get to know our team through
    the site and send us an inquiry to learn
    more.
