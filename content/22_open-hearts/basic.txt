  heading: What is this fund?
  text: >
    As urban ministry workers, our staff
    participate in forming a support team
    whose purpose includes the financial
    provision for the ministry in which the
    staff serve at Youth Unlimited. The
    "Open Hearts Assistance Fund" provides
    financial assistance to those staff who
    have not yet reached their full funding
    level through their support team. The
    root of these challenges is often linked
    to one’s network, personality and
    gifting, heritage, culture, gender,
    and/or ethnicity. It is the Fund’s aim
    to address these challenges through
    collective effort, and thereby assist in
    increasing the diversity and breadth of
    our staff team across the city,
    increasingly bringing wellbeing to all.
