  slide1heading: The "Canvas of Transformation"
  slide1text: 'At YU, we imagine transformation as God at work as a compassionate artist, painting on the canvas of both lives and neighbourhoods over time. We envision the colour palette having YU’s 5 Transformative Colours, from which any combination of colours can be created. As we invest in youth wholeness in this context, we believe we will continue to see this ‘(link: https://sites.google.com/yugta.ca/yu-canvas-of-transformation/ text: **Canvas of Transformation**)’ come to life in young people, their families, and their neighbourhoods. This is transformed youth transforming our city.'

    ***Engaging Life with Jesus***
    
    As young people grow in their journey of faith, the roots of their identity grow down deeply into a firm foundation. We envision young people finding contentment, building a healthy self-image, depending on God, and finding forgiveness, freedom, and healing.

    ***Growing in Virtue***
    
    In an increasingly connected world, we know character matters more than ever. Just like fruit in an orchard, God grows in our young people virtues such as love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, humility, goodness, and gentleness. Young people with these virtues can truly change our world.

    We believe God is at work restoring and building every relationship in our lives. We aim to see young people act as bridge builders and participate in communities that nurture belonging, faith, and sacrificial love.

    ***Putting Others First***
    
    We rejoice in seeing young people serve others, putting the needs of others before themselves. A mop and bucket symbolizes the humble acts of kindness we aim to nurture in our youth throughout the city. We believe our young people will discover lasting joy through a life of service for others.

    ***Discovering & Utilizing Gifts & Abilities***
    
    We believe every one of us has been given specific gifts, skills, and passions through which we find confidence and purpose. When young people find their 'sweet spot', it renews a sense of hope and direction, and everyone around them benefits.

  heading: Our History
  text: 'Youth Unlimited (originally Youth For Christ) was launched in 1944. Inspired by YFC rallies in Chicago, our roots in Toronto began with hosting large youth rallies at Massey Hall. These became some of the largest youth gatherings in the world at the time. Since then, YU’s entrepreneurial spirit has led us through a series of strategic shifts that clearly exemplifies our motto:  “Anchored to the Rock but geared to the times.”  Over the past 75 years our approach has developed to include weekly community clubs, proactive outreach programs, and neighbourhood-focused church partnerships.'
