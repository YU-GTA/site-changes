Body:

For our (link: https://yugta.ca/our-team?filter=Young%20Parents text: **Young Parents**) team, "letting go" of young parents who have aged out of our programs has always been the most difficult part of the team's ministry.  It's likewise difficult for the young parent, after having built significant trust over the years and with YU staff having become a primary support in their lives. 

Over the past couple of years, the team has been more intentional to move towards bridging the gap between our program and other opportunities, so that there isn't such an abrupt finish.  Their new initiative "What's Next?" - a coaching module specifically for graduating young parents - is designed to narrow in on equipping, coaching, and curating opportunities for our young parents, such as involvement in local churches, personal development courses geared toward their needs, and even the opportunity to return to our Young Parents program as volunteers. While the young moms started out feeling some trepidation about what's next , they finished feeling encouraged and hopeful about their future and the steps they will take. 

This is some of the impromptu feedback received from the young moms who participated:
     "I realized that I've grown up. I have things to contribute."
     "It's OK to ask for help. I don't need to do life alone and carry the world on my shoulders."
     "I want to find a church in my neighbourhood."
     "I have hope for my future."

The moms will continue to participate in programming until June, when they will have a graduation celebration.  Please pray with us for the very bright futures of our graduating young moms! The (link: https://yugta.ca/our-team?filter=Young%20Parents text: **Young Parents**) team considers it an honour to have been on the journey with them, and to witness their resilience and transformation!
