This summer’s (link: https://www.heart2soulfest.com/ text: **Heart 2 Soul Fest**), normally a large Jane-Finch community event, changed things up this year in order to still be able to go ahead while safely adhering to all public health protocols. This event provided a great way to celebrate the end of summer for those who attended YU’s Seeds of Hope day camp, held this summer at St. Charles Garnier Catholic School.  

The afternoon kicked off with a delicious jerk and BBQ chicken meal for all campers and volunteers, and even the school caretakers who had cared so well for the Seeds of Hope camp throughout the summer! A bubble show presentation to the campers was a hit, and the rock climbing wall provided a unique opportunity for campers to ignite their skill-building and competitive abilities.  Despite the heat of the day, the inflatable obstacle course and bouncy castle provided outlets for the children to really put their adrenaline into first gear.  The campers were led through each activity station by their youth leaders, who also enjoyed the opportunity to participate in some friendly competition with their peers.

There were many happy smiles when the day ended with prize giveaways and a raffle for the donated bicycles that had been used at the camp, which meant that most of the children who did not have a bicycle prior to the summer were able to take one home - what a great way to cap off the summer!

(YU is thankful to Trochilus Jamaican Gourmet Food Truck, Black Rock Climbers , MP Honourable Judy Sgro, and those who provided prize donations for their support of this community event.)
