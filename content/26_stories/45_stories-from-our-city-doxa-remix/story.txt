Our (link: https://www.yugta.ca/our-team?filter=DOXA text: ** Doxa**) team welcomes over 200 youth to an event they host every year called REMIX.

Following the Spirit’s lead, they decided to stray off the path they were given and go another way.

A few turns and prayers into their route they stumbled upon a church. It was a bit of a surprising discovery, given the very few Christians known to be living in the area, and they took time to pray for the ministries happening there.
