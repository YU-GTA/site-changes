Zaneta knew she was going to take time off from university, but she didn’t know what exactly would be next—that’s when she found YU.
 
Part way through her undergrad at Brock, she decided she needed a break from school and turned to God for direction. She was still unsure of what exactly would come next when she heard about YU from Mark, her friend’s dad, who also happens to be (link: https://www.yugta.ca/teams/the-shop text: **The Shop**) director.  

“At the time, I was trying to figure out what I was going to be doing with my life, and I had some other plans. I thought I should go to college or just work two-part time jobs and just make some money. But nothing was really working out,” Zaneta shared. “I was in this state where I actually didn't know what I was doing next and then Mark said, ‘How would you feel about working as an (link: https://www.yugta.ca/internship-program text: **intern at YU**)?’”
 
That conversation sparked her interest with YU, and eventually led her to join the internship cohort as an intern at (link: https://www.yugta.ca/teams/the-shop text: **The Shop**). Zaneta feels that God is often speaking to her through little moments just like that one.
 
“I think the most rewarding thing has been just learning and growing a lot because I feel like there's a lot of opportunities that I've been given to really listen and tune in to where God is calling me.”
 
One of her favourite moments was an unexpected time of connection with one of the youth visiting (link: https://www.yugta.ca/teams/the-shop text: **The Shop**). At The Shop, youth work on cars and connect with staff so they can learn new tangible skills that will help them elsewhere in life, while also receiving love and support from strong Christ-following mentors. A few weeks ago, a youth showed up but their mentor was stuck in a meeting. Zaneta jumped in and started detailing a car with the youth while they waited. Quickly they started telling jokes and getting goofy with the cleaning supplies.
