Believing in yourself sometimes means a willingness to take a figurative first step onto slippery and uncertain ice. 

For one of the youth Alison Chuck was helping to find work, this idea of taking a first step on unpredictable ice turned out to be literal. 

Alison works as a job opportunity and placement coordinator on the (link: https://yugta.ca/teams/frontiers text: **YU Frontiers team**). Her goal is to help youth find employment and discover their clear purpose. 

A few months ago, one of the youth she was working with asked her for help getting to an “ice assessment.” Alison had been coaching Anna while she searched for a job, and it turns out this test was the first step for becoming a City of Toronto ice guard. Anna was excited about the opportunity, and Alison agreed to drive her to the rink for the skating test, so  they were off. 

Alison realized they had run into trouble when the administrator described the assessment and Anna started to cry.  Anna confessed that she knew how to skate, as in not fall down, but she was not skilled enough to do what they were describing.  

Alison and Anna took a moment and talked about her strategy. What could they do now given the situation?  

Anna came to her own conclusion, choosing to try and do as much as she could.  She would not give up.  

Alison watched the assessment from the sidelines.  Halfway through, the tester asked Anna to leave, and Alison’s heart broke for her.

On the car ride home, to take their minds off the test,  they talked about different things: super powers, music, and the volunteer work Anna enjoys.  When they arrived at Anna’s house, Alison shared how proud she was of Anna for trying. Going from not doing very much to look for a job, to getting interviews and assessments. And now, showing up and doing her best was a big accomplishment.  

Anna looked at Alison with eyes that believed. She said proudly, "I never gave up! I decided even when the skates started to hurt that I would not give up and I did not!"
