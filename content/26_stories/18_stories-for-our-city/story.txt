Subheading: A note from a graduating young mom

----

Body:

This beautiful note, received from one of the young moms graduating after three years with YU, shows how God is using the gifts of grace and hospitality of our Brampton **(link: https://www.yugta.ca/our-team?filter=Young%20Parents text: Young Parent team)** to provide support for those they walk alongside. (Note: They always keep the door open to ongoing relationship with their alumni!)

"I met Sue [the Brampton **(link: https://youngparents.ca/young-moms/ text: Young Moms)** Leader] at the [Peel] Teen Supper Club. One thing about her is that her smile brightens a room. If my memory serves me correctly, Denise S. [volunteer] was there as well. I don't remember many things about the actual presentation, but I can remember the love, care and compassion as if it was yesterday. They brought the cutest care packages with a perfect balance for moms and the little ones.

I first attended the group as a 24-year-old mom of 5 children, three of which I was still mourning. I was manoeuvring new experiences that no one prepped me for. I needed to "mend" and the perfect people came by in divine timing.

Not on a single occasion have I ever felt displaced. Immediately they welcomed my children and I. If I questioned that there was a God, I'd have to eat my words.

I cannot quite [express] my immense gratitude but I know that I have gained an eternal family in these ladies. It has been a pleasure to not only know them, but to love them."
