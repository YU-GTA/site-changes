Body:

Check out this encouraging letter received earlier this summer from Rachel, a student who recently completed the **(link: https://www.yugta.ca/teams/launch text: LAUNCH **)Leadership Course, in which she describes an opportunity that came about as a result of her community impact project:

"I wanted to let you know that through my campaign, Camp Promise was able to raise $5,300 last month! It was such a blessing to be able to participate in **(link: https://www.yugta.ca/teams/launch text: LAUNCH **) this year, and Iâ€™m so glad I was able to help support Camp Promise through my project.

An added result of my project is that I was offered a summer grant position at Camp Promise. I started at the beginning of June and we have just finished our planning for the summer. Camp officially starts on Monday and will run for four weeks. Prayer for everything to go smoothly and for the chance to be able to share Jesus with the kids would be very much appreciated. ðŸ˜Š

I can honestly say that I wouldnâ€™t be where I am right now without **(link: https://www.yugta.ca/teams/launch text: LAUNCH **). I am so grateful to you all for leading this program. I was able to learn so much from you guys [which] means a lot to me."
