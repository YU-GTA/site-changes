Our **(link: https://www.yujanefinch.ca/ text: Seeds of Hope)** Enterprising Youth program was an immense success thanks to the initiative and teaching of Professors Mary Han and Nikhil Celly, and it ended on a high note! This program is aimed at teaching our youths ages 9 to14 all they need to know about the ins and outs of starting a business.

God graciously blessed us with 12 loving and faithful volunteers who assisted the young participants in this program! The volunteers joyfully gave over 3 hours each week, to serve as mentors. They prayed for and supported the youths as they developed and prepared their business plans. 

Each week, over the span of 12 weeks, we left excited, encouraged, and blessed by the enthusiasm and diligence the youth displayed as they ventured into discovering some of the amazing things God can do in and through them. After spending these weeks preparing with the help of their mentors, all 4 teams of 29 young future entrepreneurs presented their business plans to a panel of judges from the business and finance industry. At the awards ceremony which followed, the participants were encouraged by messages from local MPs Judy Sgro and Jean Yip and Minister Todd Smith along with Ramon Williams, a rising young entrepreneur from the community.
