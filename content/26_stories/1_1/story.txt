As we march into Spring all our (link: https://yugta.ca/teams/jane-finch text: Seeds of Hope) virtual programs via Zoom continues to blossom and be a source of joy and hope for the kids and families in the Jane/Finch Community and beyond!

The (link: https://yugta.ca/teams/jane-finch text:  Seeds of Hope) Club resumed in February with great anticipation and excitement, as we launched our Enterprising Youth Program! Thanks to the very generous offer of their services, two wonderful and gifted University Business Professors, designed the Enterprising Youth Program which they present each week to the kids. This program is aimed at teaching our youths ages 9-14 all they need to know about the ins and outs of starting a business!

God has graciously blessed us with 12 loving and faithful volunteers who assist the 30 youth who attend! They joyfully give over 3 hours each week, to serve as mentors. They pray for and support the youths as they develop and prepare their business plans. These plans will then be presented to a panel of judges at the end of April. Each week we leave excited, encouraged, and blessed by the enthusiasm and diligence the youth display as they venture into discovering some of the amazing things God can do in and through them!

Our other programs such as The (link: https://yugta.ca/teams/jane-finch text: Seeds of Hope) Mums continue each week. The hope and joy both participants and mentors experience, is evident as they look forward to attending the meetings. These have become a vital lifeline, especially amid the Covid-19 lockdowns and challenges. They are an important outlet for the participants at a time when many are feeling more isolated, anxious, fearful, and hopeless!  Our programs have become a place where participants can express themselves freely, be heard, and are encouraged from God’s word to find their purpose. All this while developing friendships and experiencing God's amazing love! 

Attendance at the His Royal Diadems girls’ program has grown from the initial 8 to now 16 girls, ages 8-14 years.  As the girls attend and find a place for them to belong, they invite their friends to sign up and join the program too. They have grown in their confidence and knowledge of who God made them to be! Praise God so far 5 of the girls have made commitments to follow Christ!
