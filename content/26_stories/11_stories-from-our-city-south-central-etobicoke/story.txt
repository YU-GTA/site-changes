Earlier this year, our **(link: https://www.yugta.ca/our-team?filter=South-Central%20Etobicoke text: South-Central Etobicoke team)** delivered pizzas to high school students from their various programs. This was made possible by the generous donation of funds from supporters.  

Not surprisingly, the unexpected pizza deliveries were well received by youth!  More importantly, the porch drop-offs provided an opportunity for our team to check in with their youth and to connect about how they were faring with continued online learning and limited social interaction due to Covid restrictions. With donated funds to cover 50 extra large pizzas and other types of meal drop-offs, they far exceeded their goal of 40! 

Please continue to pray for the youth of our communities during this challenging time.
