Body:

The (link: https://www.yugta.ca/teams/light-patrol text: Light Patrol) team had a full house last week with 25 youth from their hotel program joining in for a Thanksgiving celebration! 

The team of talented food volunteers prepared a full Thanksgiving meal that included turkey, stuffing, roasted vegetables, pasta, gravy, cranberry sauce, and of course some delicious desserts!  Other YU staff and volunteers also assisted to make all the details for this special evening come together and run smoothly.

After the meal, the team had several activities prepared for the youth, including 'gratitude cards'. The youth were encouraged to write something they were thankful for and then to pin it to the board. It was definitely encouraging to read what they had to share! The photo shows some of those things the youth were grateful for.

The (link: https://www.yugta.ca/our-team?filter=Light%20Patrol text: Light Patrol team) gives thanks to God for the safe space they have been able to make for the youth who attend this program, as well as the friendships that are forming each week.
