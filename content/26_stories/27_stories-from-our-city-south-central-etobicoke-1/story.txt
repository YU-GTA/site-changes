Body:

During lockdown, one youth who had previously attended YU's Lakeshore Soccer, Leader in Training, and Camp Widjiitiwin programs for years joined an online Alpha group offered by the South-Central Etobicoke team. Over the course of the Alpha program, staff saw his faith grow, and observed him enjoying the group discussions and community, even when sessions were being held online. After Alpha ended, he went on to volunteer at Camp Capstone, volunteering reliably and serving with diligence. 

Becky Cripps, SCE Team Leader says, "It was wonderful to have him be a part of the camps, and I could see his sense of belonging increasing with the church community of Capstone. When camp ended, he still wanted to be at the church, so he started coming out on Sunday mornings, to youth group in the fall, and this past winter he started helping out with our junior high ministry. It's been wonderful to see him increase in his sense of belonging and in turn to see his faith and service grow!"
