Title: Stories From Our City | Light Patrol

Name: Young Adults Envision Goals and Hopes at Light Patrol's Hotel Program

----

Subheading: Story shared by Nicole Cho, Outreach Worker & Oversight Team of Light Patrol

Body: At last month's hotel program run by YU's Light Patrol, we had a good turnout with ten youth joining us despite the long gap since our Christmas party! Each of the youth created a vision board consisting of their dreams, goals and mottos which were compiled into a collage to help them be inspired and motivated (see photo above). At the end of the evening, we went around the circle and everyone shared what their boards represented. As we desire our youth to grow in discovering and utilizing their gifts and abilities, we hope they will refer to their creations when they need a quick reminder of their goals and focus for this year. What a great way to have started off the new year!
