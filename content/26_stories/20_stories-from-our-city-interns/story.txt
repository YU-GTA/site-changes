Body:

We were so grateful for our (link: https://www.yugta.ca/our-team?filter=Intern%20Cohort text: first "cohort" of interns) who served faithfully and patiently through the pandemic! Many of them stayed the course through the ups and downs of online programs, modified outreaches, and eventually, many had the privilege of doing in-person ministries. We had interns who helped with Light Patrol, Rahab, DOXA, Communications and beyond. 

The staff were honoured to journey with each individual and were able to see many answered prayers. We even have a few interns interested in youth ministry for the long-term! At the end of August, we were able to celebrate with the whole crew with a "graduation" ceremony (see photo with graduates, (link: https://www.yugta.ca/our-team/elita-fung text: Elita) and(link: https://www.yugta.ca/our-team/melissa-williams text:  Melissa), Internship Lead). We were able to recount the ways God had been faithful, munch on some individually packaged snacks, and pray over our interns. 

Thank you, interns, for your service! We're currently in the midst of starting our second year and we're excited to see what is in store!
