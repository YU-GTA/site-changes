Michael Morrison leads (link: https://www.yugta.ca/teams/doxa text: **DOXA**) Prep, a weekly academic support and mentorship program designed to assist youth practically, guide them socially, and embolden them spiritually. He tells of the transformation witnessed in a grade 7 student who attended the program:

"When 'Tyler' first joined, he was very shy and reserved, and it was hard to see what a vibrant young man he was on the inside. We were intentional in our approach to getting to know him more.  By the time he had been with us for a few weeks, we had gained valuable insight into who he is and what motivates him. 

With that in mind, we were able to discover how he learns best and how to relate to him more effectively. In turn, we were able to affirm some great qualities that can often be misunderstood or misinterpreted by his reserved nature. His mother appreciates that we've been able to take such a thorough approach to working with her son. By getting to know him well, we were able to cater our approach to supporting him academically, socially, and spiritually. He has come out of his shell, and it is clear that because he is well understood and in a safe, affirming environment, he can be his best and most authentic self."
