YU's Young Moms group in Etobicoke met in-person this month for the first time since March 2020! 

The young moms expressed their excitement at getting out of the house, letting someone else hold their baby and watch their child for a moment while sharing stories and experience with each other. They felt warmly welcomed in a non-judgemental space. One young mom said, "I didn't know things like this existed. I thought I was alone." 

With the generous partnership of Capstone Community Bible Church, the young moms were also given presents in celebration of Christmas.
