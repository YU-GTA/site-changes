YU's **(link: https://www.doxatoronto.com/our-team text:  DOXA ministry team )** has been producing an online weekly devotional series for youth.  Designed to encourage young people to develop healthy Bible-reading habits, topics have included the importance of reading the Bible, reading strategies, tips on how to discover God's promises, and making Bible-reading a daily habit.

In addition to individual youth tuning in on a weekly basis, some youth leaders have been using the videos as discussion-starters with their youth groups, allowing the youth to dialogue with one another about the concepts discussed in each video.

You can check out the entire series (it's free!) on DOXA's YouTube page linked **(link: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCf8H-HUoHx-o87R1u5oqc0A text: HERE)**
