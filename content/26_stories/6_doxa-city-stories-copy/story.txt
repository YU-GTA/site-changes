Body:

Project Serve is not a “pandemic proof” ministry.  At its very core is the concept of bringing people together to serve vulnerable populations together. All this togetherness is just not allowed right now.  So, like many other Youth Unlimited programs, it meant a rethink and reimagine of the ways in which they could continue to do ministry in this season. Having recently returned from a maternity leave, Jenn Mikelait, Project Serve's Coordinator, says, "Visioning and dreaming up new ideas is something that I love, so these first few weeks of time back at Project Serve have been good in many ways!"

Speaking about her plans to soon begin offering school workshops, Jenn says, "This is an exciting idea for me because I enjoy helping youth get a different perspective on poverty and people experiencing homelessness. I am also beginning to recruit churches for potential day trips during the summer, and planning safe ways in which groups can serve alongside partner organizations."  Seeking outdoor areas in which the team can meet together at the start of the day and then again at the end for debriefing sessions are part of the planning process.  Jenn also hopes to provide the opportunity for families to serve together, which could be as simple as a park clean up or doing some outside maintenance work at a home for refugees.  Watch this space for news of what becomes of the planning currently underway, and for how God uses these ministry pivots to reach youth in new ways.
