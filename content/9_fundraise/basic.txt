    We partner with CanadaHelps to create a
    platform where you can bring your great
    ideas to life to come alongside
    vulnerable youth in our city. Whether
    it’s dedicating your birthday gifts to
    helping young parents, committing to
    riding your bike everywhere for 1 month
    to send kids to camp, shaving your head,
    or walking 3km a day to help homeless
    youth find housing, it’s as easy as
    setting up a campaign page at
    CanadaHelps and getting your friends and
    family involved.
