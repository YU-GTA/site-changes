    Making Space is YU’s discerned way
    forward so we can all make a meaningful
    impact together, and be empowered to
    live out our calling as staff,
    volunteers, and donors for the sake of
    the youth of the GTA.

    We simply cannot ignore the disparities,
    inequity, and injustice facing young
    people on the margins each day –
    whether by virtue of their
    circumstances, internal struggles, or
    even where they live. By fostering
    transformation among these precious
    friends of ours, we hope to see their
    renewal bring hope and flourishing to
    every inch of our city. To do so, we
    will intentionally increase our
    engagement with vulnerable youth, with
    the hope that a growing number of these
    friends will experience wholistic
    transformation.

    Many of us are all-too-aware of the
    growing mental health epidemic among
    young people, and it’s a reality our
    staff grapple with in each of our
    programs across the city. Our hope is
    that no young person we serve would go
    through these struggles alone. We know
    it’s imperative that we be a
    consistent, loving, and well-equipped
    presence for the sake of these young
    people’s wellbeing. Therefore, we will
    intentionally accompany youth in the
    midst of their mental health challenges,
    with the hope that they feel
    well-supported and are better able to
    flourish.

    Furthermore, we know young people need
    to find a vibrant community of belonging
    that nurtures their faith and wellbeing
    for life–well into their adult years.
    We believe, too, that young people can
    breathe life into local churches
    throughout the city. To this end, we
    will intentionally come alongside
    neighbourhood churches to engage in
    mission together, with the hope that all
    our youth will find a long-term place of
    belonging in vibrant local Christian
    communities.

    Seeing young lives radically changed by
    personal experiences of God remains the
    heartbeat of Youth Unlimited.
    Transformed youth transforming our city
    is a vision born out of our “Canvas of
    Transformation” coming to life in the
    individuals and communities we serve. We
    will intentionally live out wholistic
    transformation as team members together
    with our youth, with the hope that more
    and more young people will experience
    God’s transformative work in their
    lives.
