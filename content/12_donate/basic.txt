  question1: >
    Is donating online secure? Can I give
    offline, too?
  answer1: 'Yes! We are proud to partner with CanadaHelps, which upholds gold standard industry security practices. When you give online, CanadaHelps will send you a tax receipt and forward the money to YU within one week. You can also give offline by printing and mailing us (link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CQfK8uHLYaEsbFAHF_0J1MCfsmpHQxwi/view?usp=sharing text: this form).'
  question2: >
    How do I set up a monthly donation or
    update my monthly support, or make a
    change to how my donations are
    designated?
  answer2: "Please email yuadmin@yugtca or give us a call at 416-383-1477, and we'll be happy to help you. If your current monthly donation is via CanadaHelps, you'll have to change with them — but we can help you with that, too!"
  question3: "What is YU's charity registration number and restricted giving policy?"
  answer3: 'We operate as Youth Unlimited with the legal name Toronto Youth For Christ. Our charitable registration number is 140813502 RR 0001. Our restricted giving policy is: If a designated account is at some future time closed, any funds remaining in it will be re-allocated to another project or account as needed. If the annual need for a designated account has been met, the program/project leader may request that any surplus be designated towards other critical staff needs. All such decisions are approved by the Executive Director and/or Board of Directors.'
  question4: When will I receive my tax receipt?
  answer4: "We are so grateful for your support! YU sends out tax receipts in February for all giving in the prior tax year. If you didn't receive one, please call 416-383-1477 and we'd be happy to send you a replacement receipt. Please note that if you gave online through CanadaHelps, your tax receipt is handled by CanadaHelps and emailed to you. "
