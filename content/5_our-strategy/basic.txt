    Youth Unlimited continues to be guided
    by our Making Space pathways in the
    areas of vulnerable youth, mental
    health, church integration of youth, and
    living out wholistic transformation. In
    the coming four years, we believe God is
    inviting us to ‘gain ground’ – to
    invest and reach into new places, new
    spaces, and new ways of doing things to
    see more and more transformed youth
    transforming our city. Our Gaining
    Ground strategy is guided by five
    commitments. We are excited for you to
    join us on the journey!

  slide1heading: Stable Housing
  slide1text: |
    **Commitment 1: Address the urgent need for stable housing among youth and their families.**
    
    *Over the last two years, 88% of our ministry teams across the GTA have had to address housing insecurity with the youth they serve and support.*
    
    Recognizing the urgent need for stable housing among those we serve, we will support our YU youth and their families facing housing insecurity through a collaborative multi-faceted approach, including providing housing opportunities and fostering “radical hospitality” in the Christian community.

    **Commitment 2: Develop multi-service spaces offering wholistic supports to youth and their families.**
    
    *Studies show that youth with at least one consistent, trusted adult in their life minimize their risk of disengaging from education and employment, and more strongly develop their identity, empathy, and a sense of hope for the future.*
    
    In order to deepen our wholistic engagement with youth and their families, we will pilot safe and familiar multi-service spaces.

  slide3heading: Neighbourhood Church Mobilization
  slide3text: |
    **Commitment 3: Mobilize neighbourhood churches to integrate community youth and their families.**
    
    *According to 12 of our most experienced frontline staff, churches embedded in their neighbourhood with an intentional plan and multiple approaches to welcome and engage youth are most likely to help these young people experience long-term belonging in their faith community.*
    
    Given our desire to increase engagement between neighbourhood churches and community youth throughout their lives, we will proactively encourage, equip, mobilize and partner with local churches to design and implement effective support structures and ‘pathways of integration’ for neighbourhood youth.

    **Commitment 4: Launch new ministries among both under-served youth and neighbourhoods.**
    
    *Youth Unlimited currently serves in five of Toronto’s 31 Neighbourhood Improvement Areas.*
    
    Given our vision and desire that every youth in the GTA will be transformed by God’s love, we will proactively start up ministry initiatives to serve new neighbourhoods and/or under-served youth populations.

    **Commitment 5: Cultivate a collaborative partnership with YFC South Sudan.**
    
    *After more than two decades of civil war, the median age of South Sudan is 18.6 years, compared to 41 years in Canada.*
    
    As part of the international YFC movement, in order to more effectively fulfill our shared vision of reaching every young person locally and globally, we will enter into a collaborative partnership with YFC South Sudan.

    Building upon the well-established
    Scarborough presence of our DOXA team,
    we will pilot a ‘hub’ space in this
    community to offer comprehensive
    supports to young people and their
    families. This space will engage other
    YU teams and partnering churches to
    impact youth and families in a variety
    of ways (job skills training,
    counseling, fitness programs, etc.). As
    our strategy unfolds, we will also
    explore piloting a mobile space to meet
    the unique needs of those served by our
    Rahab team.

    We will work to expand our network of
    meaningful church partnerships,
    especially among diaspora communities.
    Specifically, we will pilot partnerships
    with three churches in different
    neighbourhoods and equip them to help
    see youth flourish in these communities
    of faith. Finally, we will grow and
    train a network of volunteers within
    church communities to offer wholistic
    support through circles of care to youth
    experiencing vulnerability.

    We will aim to launch three new

    under-served communities, as well as one
    new specialized program reaching a
    specific demographic of under-served
    youth. To support this growth, our
    recruitment strategy will focus on
    building a team of young frontline
    workers in these initiatives.

    For Youth Unlimited to move forward with
    this Gaining Ground strategy, recruiting
    young ministry workers, primarily
    through our internship program, will
    remain a key focus. Over the next four
    years, we will continue building the
    internship program to support the growth
    and development of both existing and new
    ministries, while also developing youth
    workers for effective service. Click the
    link below to learn more about our
    internship program. If you would like to
    learn more about how you or your church
    can help Youth Unlimited gain ground in
    one of these five commitments, contact
    Carl Nash, our Ministry Director, at
