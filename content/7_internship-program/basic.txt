      about internship
  question1: 'How long is the internship program? '
  answer1: 'The internship ranges from 6 months - 2 years, depending on the needs of the individual. As the internship experience draws to a close, interns enter into a discernment process to help better understand their calling and next steps. From there, interns may extend their internship, step into a role with Youth Unlimited, or pursue their career in another vocational context.'
  question2: >
    Is the internship program a paid
    opportunity?
  answer2: >
    Interns may choose to take part in this
    program unpaid, or choose to be paid
    through support raising. Training and
    support is provided during the
    fundraising process by our internship
    team.

    What experiences will I have throughout
